In this guide, we will explain the parameters for single extruder multimaterial printing (SEMM) in OrcaSlicer. The whole process and parameters are same as in PrusaSlicer, as OrcaSlicer is based on PrusaSlicer.

OrcaSlicer has some additional features and minor differences though. We will explain them in this guide.
