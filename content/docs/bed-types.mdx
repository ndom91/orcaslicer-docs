Next, you can select the bed type in the drop-down menu, corresponding bed temperature will be set automatically.
You can set the bed temperature for each bed type in the filament settings as demonstrated above.

Orca also support `curr_bed_type` variable in custom G-code. For example, the following sample G-codes can detect the selected bed type and adjust the G-code offset accordingly for Klipper:

```gcode
{if curr_bed_type=="Textured PEI Plate"}
  SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=-0.05
{else}
  SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=0.0
{endif}
```

Available bed types include the following.

- "Cool Plate"
- "Engineering Plate"
- "High Temp Plate"
- "Textured PEI Plate"
